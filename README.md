# Microsoft-Azure-Hackathon
Team Potted's code repository for Microsoft Azure Hackathon 2020

Microsoft Azure Hackthon 2020 was launched in partnership with the United Nation Development Programme(UNDP) and Grab to seek innovative solutions implemented using Microsoft Azure Artifical Intelligence(AI) tools to real-world challenges provided by UNDP and Grab. Team Potted chose to take on the challenge posed by UNDP, which is on the topic of Urban Farming, focused on mitigating the incursion of pest and disease in agriculture, particularly for urban farms.

This code repository contains Team Potted's solution prototype, developed based on the following (revised) system architecture diagram.

A critical limitation of our solution is the lack of physical plant samples and lack of a physical Internet Of Things(IoT) device(and sensors) to detect and collect real-life plant data and send it to the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub in real-time.
